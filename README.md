  This is the sacred space where I share:
  <ul>
    <li>🙃 I still haven't completely fallen in love with languages</li>
    <li>😊 My name is Nicollas and thank you for visiting my page!</li>
    <li>🚀 Wanting to Learn New Things, this time it was programming!</li>
    <li>👴 I want to have adventure stories to tell my grandchildren!</li>
  </ul>
